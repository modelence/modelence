## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="node-js" title="Node.js">
    [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above
    
    - When installing Node.js, make sure to check all checkboxes related to dependencies
    - Node.js installation includes NPM (Node Package Manager) which is required
    - You can verify your installation by running:
    
    ```bash
    node --version
    npm --version
    ```
    
    If you see version numbers displayed for both commands, you're ready to start building with Modelence!
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Creating a new project

You can create a new Modelence project using the `create-modelence-app` command.

```bash
npx create-modelence-app@latest my-app
```

This command will create a new directory named `my-app` with the necessary files and folders for your project.

## Project structure

The project structure for a Modelence app is as follows:

```
my-app/
├── src/
│   ├── client/
│   │   ├── index.html
│   │   ├── index.css
│   │   ├── index.tsx
│   │   ├── routes.ts
│   ├── server/
│   │   ├── app.ts
├── .modelence.env
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="code" title="Client Files">
    - **`client/index.html`** The main layout for your application. You usually don't need to edit this file.
    - **`client/index.css`** Global CSS styles, including Tailwind CSS configuration.
    - **`client/index.tsx`** Entry point for your React frontend where you initialize the client app.
    - **`client/routes.ts`** Define your client-side routes and their corresponding components.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="server" title="Server Files">
    - **`server/app.ts`** Server entry point where you configure your backend modules and start the server.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="gear" title="Config Files">
    - **`.modelence.env`** Environment variables for your application (including API tokens for applications connected to Modelence Cloud)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
All client-side code goes in the `src/client` directory, while server-side code belongs in `src/server`.
Modelence uses a clear separation between client and server code to help maintain a clean architecture.
You can also use any other directories at the same level as `src/client` and `src/server` for shared code between client and server.
</Tip>

## Start your application

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    Navigate to your project directory and install the required packages:
    
    ```bash
    cd my-app
    npm install
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run the development server">
    Start the development server:
    
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    
    The `npm run dev` command builds your website locally and serves it through a Vite development server,
    ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/ (or the port you specified in the `.env` file).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="View your application">
    If everything is set up correctly, you should see the Modelence new project home page in your browser.
  </Step>
</Steps>
