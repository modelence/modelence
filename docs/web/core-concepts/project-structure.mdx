A Modelence project follows a well-organized structure that clearly separates client and server code, making it easy to build full-stack applications with TypeScript.

## Directory Overview

When you create a new Modelence project, you'll see the following structure:

```
my-app/
├── src/
│   ├── client/          # Frontend code
│   ├── server/          # Backend code
│   └── shared/          # (Optional) Shared code
├── assets/              # Static assets (images, fonts)
├── .modelence.env       # Environment variables
├── package.json         # Project dependencies
└── tsconfig.json        # TypeScript configuration
```

## Client Directory

The `src/client` directory contains all your frontend React application code.

### Key Files

- **`index.html`** - The main HTML template for your application. You typically don't need to modify this file unless you want to add meta tags, external scripts, or customize the root template.

- **`index.tsx`** - The React application entry point. This is where you initialize your client-side app using `renderApp()` and configure providers.

  ```typescript
  import { renderApp } from 'modelence/client';
  import routes from './routes';
  import './index.css';

  renderApp({
    routes,
  });
  ```

- **`index.css`** - Global CSS styles for your application. This file typically includes Tailwind CSS imports and any global style customizations.

- **`routes.ts`** - Client-side routing configuration that maps URL paths to React components.

  ```typescript
  import { createBrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
  import Home from './pages/Home';
  import About from './pages/About';

  export default createBrowserRouter([
    { path: '/', element: <Home /> },
    { path: '/about', element: <About /> },
  ]);
  ```

### Organizing Client Code

Within the `client` directory, you can organize your code into subdirectories:

```
src/client/
├── components/       # Reusable React components
├── pages/           # Page-level components
├── hooks/           # Custom React hooks
└── utils/           # Client-side utilities
```

## Server Directory

The `src/server` directory contains all your backend code, including API logic, database models, and business logic.

### Key Files

- **`app.ts`** - The server entry point where you configure and start your Modelence application.

  ```typescript
  import { startApp } from 'modelence/server';
  import todoModule from './todo';

  startApp({
    modules: [todoModule],
  });
  ```

### Organizing Server Code by Modules

The recommended approach is to organize server code into **modules** - self-contained units of functionality:

```
src/server/
├── todo/
│   ├── index.ts      # Module definition
│   ├── db.ts         # Database stores
│   └── utils.ts      # Module utilities
├── users/
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── db.ts
└── app.ts            # Main server file
```

Each module typically contains:
- **Module definition** - Queries, mutations, and configuration
- **Database stores** - MongoDB collection definitions
- **Business logic** - Domain-specific utilities and helpers

<Tip>
Grouping code by modules (domains/features) rather than by type (controllers, models, etc.) makes your codebase more maintainable and easier to understand as it grows.
</Tip>

## Shared Code

You can create a `src/shared` directory (or any other name) for code that needs to be used by both client and server:

```
src/
├── client/
├── server/
└── shared/
    ├── types.ts      # Shared TypeScript types
    ├── constants.ts  # Shared constants
    └── utils.ts      # Shared utilities
```

<Warning>
Be careful when importing server code into client code or vice versa.
</Warning>

## Configuration Files

### .modelence.env

Environment-specific configuration for your application. This file should never be committed to version control.

```env
# MongoDB connection
MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://..."

# Other configuration
PORT=3000
```

<Warning>
Always add `.modelence.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent committing sensitive credentials.
</Warning>

### package.json

Standard Node.js package configuration. Modelence projects include these key scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "modelence dev",
    "build": "modelence build",
    "start": "node dist/server/app.js"
  }
}
```

### tsconfig.json

TypeScript configuration for your project. Modelence sets up appropriate defaults for both client and server code with path aliases and module resolution.

## Build Output

When you build your application with `npm run build`, Modelence generates a `dist` directory:

```
dist/
├── client/          # Built frontend assets
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── assets/
│   └── ...
└── server/          # Compiled server code
    └── app.js
```

The built application is ready for deployment to any Node.js hosting platform.
